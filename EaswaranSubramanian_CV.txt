SUMMARY

As a dedicated professional and master's in Machine Learning student at Tübingen University, I am driven by the challenge
of creating and scaling advanced AI systems. I am skilled in Python, SQL and have hands-on knowledge in building ML
Models, automating workflows and translating complex data in meaningful insights across different domains. 


My 3+ years of work experience in data science and machine learning has led me to a strong interest in MLOps,
operationalising generative AI and predictive modeling, and I am focused on leveraging my skills to make a tangible
impact by bringing cutting-edge models to life.

EXPERIENCE
Tübingen Institute for Medical Education, Tübingen, Germany
Nov 2023 - Jul 2024 

Research Student - Programming and Web Interface
 

Created a web interface to analyse survey data from over 200 final-year medical students and nurses, providing
educational insights. 

Built an admin page with PHP and JavaScript and managed data storage and retrieval using MySQL.

Developed interactive data visualisations using a library like Chart.js and Plotly to present complex survey results in an
intuitive format.

Implemented a secure user authentication system with session management to protect sensitive survey data and ensure
access was restricted to authorised personnel using PHP and MySQL.


Sony B.V. Stuttgart Technology Center, Stuttgart, Germany
. Mar 2023 - Aug 2023

Working Student - Machine Learning Engineer

Supported the R&D with building a custom Neural Architecture Search (NAS) framework in PyTorch, running over 20
comparative experiments to validate a projected performance increase of up to 20%.


Optimised the end-to-end machine learning pipeline by developing efficient data preprocessing scripts and conducting
systematic hyper-parameter tuning to find optimal network configurations.

Managed the project's codebase using GitLab for version control, where I contributed to refactoring modules for
improved efficiency and authored technical documentation for new components.



Verloop.io, Bengaluru, India
Mar 2022 - Sep 2022

Data Analyst

Applied NLP techniques, including topic modeling and sentiment analysis, to analyze and categorize thousands of user
queries, identifying key customer pain points and behaviour patterns.

Designed and built interactive dashboards using Matplotlib to provide the Customer Success team with real-time
insights into chatbot performance and customer satisfaction KPIs.

Developed and automated reporting pipelines in Python, which reduced the time required for weekly report generation
by 70%, freeing up the team to focus on proactive customer engagement.

Collaborated closely with the Customer Success and Product teams to present actionable findings, directly influencing
the refinement of chatbot conversation flows and user experience strategy.

Quantum AI Systems, Hyderabad, India
Jan 2021 - Feb 2022 

Machine Learning Intern

Implemented and compared ConvLSTM and LRCN deep learning models for video classification, developing a data
preprocessing pipeline with OpenCV and training the networks using TensorFlow and Keras.

Adapted the models for a customer service use case and deployed the final solution into a user-friendly web interface
using Flask.


Tiger Analytics, Chennai, India
.
Jan 2020 - Nov 2021 

Senior Data Analyst

Supported a large-scale pricing strategy project for a major fast-food client, delivering optimal menu price
recommendations that drove a projected 10-15% increase in revenue across more than 15 global markets.

Developed and implemented a price optimisation model using Conjoint Analysis to simulate customer choice and
forecast the impact of price changes on key business metrics like sales, revenue, and gross margin.

Utilised the COBYLA (Constrained Optimisation by Linear Approximation) algorithm to solve complex, non-linear
optimisation problems, balancing the objective of revenue maximisation against critical business constraints such as
price ceilings and sales volume limits.

Authored and refactored the project's analytical codebase in Python, enhancing its efficiency and scalability to handle
diverse market data and complex modeling requirements.

Conducted extensive scenario modeling and sensitivity analysis to evaluate hundreds of potential pricing strategies,
providing the client with a clear understanding of the trade-offs between different business outcomes.

Synthesised complex analytical findings into actionable market-level insights, leading communication and presenting
strategic recommendations to senior client stakeholders and internal leadership teams.

RECENT PROJECTS
Masters Thesis: Reproducing and Adapting the Hypencoder [In-Progress]

Supervisor: Prof. Carsten Eickhoff - NLP Health Lab, Tübingen
. Oct 2025 - present
Reimplementing the Hypencoder framework, a novel Information Retrieval model that uses a hypernetwork to
dynamically generate a query-specific neural network for more expressive relevance scoring.

Analysing a graph-based greedy search algorithm to assess the trade-offs between retrieval speed and accuracy when
compared against a traditional search approach on a large-scale document corpus.

Investigating potential improvements to the model's architecture - The primary experiment focuses on adapting the qnet to accept multi-vector document representations instead of a single vector, aiming to enhance performance on
complex and hard retrieval tasks.


AI Agent Robustness Testing Framework

Developed an automation framework to systematically evaluate the robustness of a ReAct-style LLM agent, testing its
performance against various data corruption scenarios like shuffled column headers, missing values, etc.

Engineered and refined the agent's prompts to improve its reasoning and tool-using capabilities, enabling it to correctly
interpret corrupted data schemas and still answer questions accurately.

Built the agent's architecture using the LangGraph library to create a cyclical graph of nodes representing the agent's
state, and used Pandas for all data manipulation and analysis within the agent's tools.
